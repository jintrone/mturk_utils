                <p>Read the following post and indicate the approximate percentage of words that are dedicated to
                    telling stories.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    For our purposes, a&nbsp;<strong>STORY</strong> is defined as as one or more episodes, where an
                    episode consists of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An initiating event&mdash;either internal (emotional or cognitive, such as &ldquo;I became
                        unhappy with my weight&rdquo;) or external (e.g., &ldquo;I developed a tumor&rdquo;)
                    </li>
                    <li>One or more intentional actions or a specific plan to engage in such actions to address the
                        initiating event (e.g., &quot;I went on a diet&quot; or &quot;I went for radiation treatments&quot;
                        or &quot;I&#39;m going for radiation treatments tomorrow&quot;). Actions do not have to be
                        written in first person. For example, &quot;the doctor gave me a prescription for zoloft&quot;;
                        describes an intentional action taken by &quot;the doctor.&quot;</li>
                    <li>Optionally, a set of consequences (e.g., &quot;I didn&#39;t lose weight&quot; or &quot;The tumor
                        shrank&quot;).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A story may contain contextual information that is needed to understand the story (e.g., &quot;I have
                    been overweight all my life&quot; or &quot;My father died of cancer&quot;). Initiating events and
                    intentional actions must be&nbsp;<strong><i>explicit</i></strong> (not implied)<i>&nbsp;</i>for text
                    to be considered an episode.</p>

                                This post relates a lot of information about an individual&#39;s struggles to address
                                weight gain and exhaustion (or tireness) due to the onset of perimenopause. Note that
                                many of the actions are in fact intentional decisions not to act (e.g. not taking HRT,
                                not taking sleeping pills).

                                This one is tricky - there is a set up for a story, but because the &quot;I have tried

                                <p>Thanks Beth, I&#39;m not used to anybody careing for me. I have no friends. I&#39;m
                                    very independent and I have always had to take care of myself and raise myself. I
                                    think I did a pretty good job. The only thing I didn&#39;t have was guidance to tell
                                    me right from wrong, but all I had to do was look around. So you can see why I&#39;m
                                    so independent. (stubborn as they say). I&#39;ve suffered so long my attitude now is
                                    who cares. It&#39;&gt;s my daughter and son-in-law that are in the Navy, not my son.
                                    They have been around the world, they have been in harms way. When any of your
                                    family are in the Military it is always the not knowing when they are out of the
                                    country. I hope to go see them in November to take care of there newborn for a few
                                    weeks if my health is good, or I&#39;ll just suck it up like my husband says and
                                    bite the pain and do what I have to do for my 1st grandchild due the end of
                                    September. Thanks for caring. Jayne</p>

                                Again, there is some stuff in here that seems like it might be a story, but we see no
                                initiating event, and little in the way of explicit, intentional action. or plan.

                                <p>I believe chest pain warrants another examination by a doctor. From several years of
                                    interacting with neuropathy patients, this type of pain seems to me quite uncommon
                                    as a symptom of neuropathy. You could instead be dealing with some type of
                                    circulatory disorder that is itself responsible for part of the pain and numbness in
                                    your extremities. Likewise, be advised: neuropathy is NOT a medical entity in
                                    itself, but rather a symptom of other medical disorders. It can be very difficult to
                                    diagnose what that disorder is, but I don&#39;t think your long term interests are
                                    well served by giving up on trying to get your doctors to do a better job of finding
                                    that disorder. Regards and best, Red</p>

                                <p>Hi everyone. Just wanted to share that my kitten, who was really more like my baby,
                                    died this week of FIP. I had never heard of it and wanted to share in case (God
                                    forbid) this ever happens to you. <span class="bg-event">Our little guy gradually showed symptoms of lethargy, losing appetite, no interest in any toys... he just slept all the time.</span>
                                    <span class="bg-action">We took him to the vet as soon as we realized he was sleeping way more than normal, and they put him in the hospital thinking it was a parasite that was attacking his red blood cells and causing him to be anemic. After a day &amp; a night in the emergency clinic,</span>
                                    <span class="bg-conseq">the doctor discovered that his belly was swelling with fluid.</span>
                                    <span class="bg-context">At that point, I was at a family funeral, but my husband was home</span>
                                    <span class="bg-action">and went immediately to the hospital to be with him for a few minutes. After discussing the condition,</span>
                                    <span class="bg-conseq">we learned that it was fatal, incurable, and could not have been prevented.</span><span
                                            class="bg-event">So because of his pain,</span><span class="action">we decided to let him go.</span>
                                    <span class="bg-conseq">It&#39;s been heartbreaking,</span> especially because he
                                    was only 8 months old. He was the most beautiful Russian Blue with a personality
                                    that kept us laughing. He lived to cuddle with us and make us happy. If you feel
                                    like your cat is exhibiting unusual lethargy, I encourage you to quickly take him to
                                    your vet. If it&#39;s a less dangerous condition, you might have a chance to keep
                                    him healthy! We have fond memories and will miss our little guy very much.</p>
